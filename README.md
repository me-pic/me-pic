I'm a PhD student at Université de Montréal (Québec, Canada) working on the [CNeuroMod project](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod) under the supervision of Dr. Pierre Rainville - [LaNeP3](https://github.com/rainville-lab) and Dr. Pierre Bellec - [SIMEXP](https://github.com/SIMEXP). I'm interested in studying brain-body interactions 🧠🫀🫁 related to affective states.
